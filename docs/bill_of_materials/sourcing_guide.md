echo ## General Tips
echo - **New Components**: Purchase from reputable suppliers (e.g., McMaster-Carr, DigiKey, Amazon) for guaranteed quality and specifications.
echo - **Surplus/Used Components**: Check eBay, Surplus Center, or local salvage yards for motors, pulleys, and spark plugs. Test used parts thoroughly to ensure functionality.
echo - **Local Options**: Hardware stores (Home Depot, Lowe’s) and metal shops (Metal Supermarkets) are ideal for materials like steel, aluminum, and polycarbonate.
echo - **Aviation-Specific Parts**: High-voltage silicone wire and spark plug connectors may require specialty suppliers (e.g., Aircraft Spruce, Chief Aircraft).

echo ## Component-Specific Guidance
echo - **DC Motor**: Look for 1/2 HP, 12V/24V motors from treadmill or automotive applications on eBay or Surplus Center. Verify RPM range (0-4000) and torque.
echo - **PWM Controller**: Generic 30A controllers are widely available on Amazon or AliExpress. Ensure compatibility with motor voltage and current.
echo - **Timing Belt/Pulleys**: Match belt pitch (e.g., 5mm) and pulley bore to motor and magneto shafts. SDP/SI offers precise options; check eBay for cheaper alternatives.
echo - **Spark Plugs**: Automotive plugs (NGK, Champion) are available at AutoZone or Advance Auto. Used plugs from auto shops can work if cleaned and tested.
echo - **Polycarbonate Sheet**: Home Depot or Lowe’s stock standard sizes. Cut to size with a saw or have a local shop cut it for you.
echo - **Electrical Components**: DigiKey and Mouser offer reliable switches, fuses, and terminal blocks. Local electronics stores may have cheaper options.
echo - **High-Voltage Wire**: Source from aviation suppliers or McMaster-Carr for 10kV-rated silicone wire to handle magneto output safely.

echo ## Cost-Saving Tips
echo - **Bulk Buying**: Purchase wire, cable ties, and small hardware in bulk to reduce per-unit costs.
echo - **Salvage**: Repurpose motors, pulleys, or enclosures from old industrial equipment or automotive scrap.
echo - **Local Fabrication**: Work with local machine shops for custom-cut aluminum plates or steel frames to avoid shipping costs.

echo ## Safety Warning
echo - Prioritize quality for safety-critical components (e.g., emergency stop, kill switch, insulated wire). Do not compromise on insulation or grounding to save costs.
echo - Verify surplus parts meet specifications (e.g., motor RPM, wire voltage rating) before use.
